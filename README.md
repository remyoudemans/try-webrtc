# Try webRTC!

This is a project trying out websockets and webRTC, using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [simple-peer](https://github.com/feross/simple-peer).

Run it in development with `npm run dev`.

Made to work with https://github.com/remyoudemans/signalling-server.

To try it out, run this and the signalling-server locally and go to `http:localhost:3000/jeffRoom` in two separate browser windows, login in both and move your cursor around and appreciate the cursor sharing!
